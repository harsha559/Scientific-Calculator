Creating a scientific calculator using the Document Object Model (DOM) involves developing an interactive web-based calculator with advanced mathematical functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and exponents. The project typically includes the following steps:

HTML Structure: Design the layout of the calculator with buttons for numbers, operators, and functions like sine, cosine, tangent, etc. Each button is assigned an id or class for easy access.

CSS Styling: Style the calculator using CSS to make it visually appealing. This includes arranging the buttons, setting background colors, and ensuring the calculator is responsive.

JavaScript and DOM Manipulation: Write JavaScript to handle user interactions. Use DOM methods to capture button clicks, perform calculations, and update the display. This involves implementing event listeners on buttons and dynamically updating the result screen.

Functionality: Implement mathematical operations and functions. You can use JavaScript's built-in Math object to perform complex calculations like square roots, powers, trigonometric functions, and logarithms.

Error Handling: Ensure the calculator handles errors gracefully, such as dividing by zero or invalid inputs
